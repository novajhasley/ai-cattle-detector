# How to Run the Flutter Application

This guide will help you run the Flutter application on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

- Flutter SDK: Install the Flutter SDK from [here](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
- Dart SDK: Dart SDK is bundled with Flutter; it is not necessary to install Dart separately.
- An IDE: You can use an IDE like Visual Studio Code or Android Studio.
- Firebase: This project uses Firebase. Make sure you have set up Firebase for your project. You can follow the guide [here](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup).

## Steps to Run the Application

1. **Clone the repository**: Clone the repository to your local machine using the command `git clone https://github.com/novajhasley/frontiers-market-interview.git`.

2. **Navigate to the project directory**: Use the command `cd frontiers-market-interview` to navigate to the project directory.

3. **Get the packages**: Run `flutter pub get` to fetch the necessary Dart packages for the project.

4. **Run the application**: You can run the application using the command `flutter run`.

Please note that you need to have a connected device or a running emulator to run the application.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while running the application, try the following:

- **Check Flutter setup**: Run `flutter doctor` to check for any potential issues with your Flutter setup.
- **Update packages**: Sometimes, the issue can be resolved by getting the packages again. Run `flutter pub get`.
- **Clean build**: If the issue persists, try cleaning the project by running `flutter clean` and then build the project again.

If you still face issues, please raise an issue in the repository.
